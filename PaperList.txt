Xiaojin Zhu, Zoubin Ghahramani, and John Lafferty. Semi-supervised learning using Gaussian fields and harmonic functions. 

In The 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2003. ICML 10-Year Classic Paper Prize. 
A graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm that creates a graph over labeled and unlabeled examples. 
More similar examples are connected by edges with higher weights. 
The intuition is for the labels to propagate on the graph to unlabeled data. 
The solution can be found with simple matrix operations, and has strong connections to spectral graph theory.
